# check_hygiene.sh: refuse to commit a credential, an employer reference, or an em or en dash in Markdown.
#
# Adapted from lacs-project/sysknife scripts/check_no_secrets.sh (MIT,
# Copyright (c) 2026 Vladimir Rotariu), which explains the length-bounded
# patterns in full: a bare `sk-` or `ghp_` rule would flag every short test
# fixture and get switched off within a day, so each pattern carries the real
# format's minimum body length.
#
# This repository is a personal project. It also refuses the name of the
# author's employer anywhere in tracked text, so ownership is never in doubt
# once the repository is public. The name is assembled at runtime so this file
# does not match itself.
#
# Usage:
#   check_hygiene.sh --staged      what `git commit` is about to record
#   check_hygiene.sh --tracked     every tracked file (CI)
