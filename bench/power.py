"""Timed runs happen on mains power only.

A laptop caps CPU and GPU power when unplugged, so a number measured on battery
describes the battery. `run_on_mains` waits while the machine is on battery,
then runs the timed function with a watcher that samples the power state; if
the charger went at any point during the run, the result is thrown away and
the run repeated once power is back, up to `max_retries` times.

The check fails closed. A supply file that cannot be read raises
`PowerReadError` instead of reading as mains, a battery with the adapter
offline counts as battery whatever its status says (`Not charging` and
`Unknown` are real values), and every run records where its power came from:
`power_source` is `mains`, `battery` or `none` (a machine that exposes no
battery, such as a desktop or a VM), next to a snapshot of what was read.

MOJO_DLLM_POWER_SUPPLY points the check at another directory laid out like
/sys/class/power_supply, so a test can unplug a fake charger mid-run. A run
that used another root records it as `power_root`.
