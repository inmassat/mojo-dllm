"""A running vLLM server as a GSM8K engine (issue #179): a client for its OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

The engine never starts or stops a server and loads no weights. It asks a server somebody else started, over HTTP
(`--base-url`), to answer each problem with `POST /v1/chat/completions`: one user message holding the same prompt
text the other engines use, `temperature` 0 and `max_tokens` equal to the generation length. The server applies the
model's chat template, so the template is the server's and `flags` says so.

Field names were read from vLLM's source (main, 2026-11-09), not from memory:

- `GET /version` answers `{"version": ...}` (vllm/entrypoints/serve/instrumentator/basic.py).
- `GET /v1/models` answers one card per served name with `id`, `root` (the model path given to `vllm serve`) and
  `max_model_len` (vllm/entrypoints/openai/models/serving.py).
- A diffusion model defines the Prometheus counter `vllm:diffusion_num_denoising_steps` (vllm/v1/spec_decode/metrics.py:
  "Number of denoising steps", the spec-decode counters under diffusion names). The source has no `_total`;
  prometheus_client adds it when it exposes a Counter, so `/metrics` should say `..._total`. That suffix is inferred
  from prometheus_client, not seen on a live server, and the parser accepts both names. The counter is server-wide,
  not per request, so the change across one request is that request's step count only when nothing else runs on
  the server: the run is refused unless `--max-num-seqs 1` is declared (the value the server was started with; the
  client cannot read it), and the runbook says to run one client. The adapter reads the counter before and after
  each generation. When the server has no such counter, `forward_passes` is null; the engine never invents a count.

What the server cannot tell the client comes from options and is recorded as declared, not verified:
`--quantization` (required, and part of the arm's `model` so `compare --across-weights` sees different weights),
`--attention-backend` and `--chat-template`. `--checkpoint` is compared with the `root` the server reports and a
difference is refused.

The isolation checks (`bench/isolation.py`) run on the CLIENT machine only. A remote server's GPU, clocks and
neighbours are not observed, and `flags` says `"server": "remote"` so nobody reads them as the server's.
