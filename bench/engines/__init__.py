"""Engines the GSM8K runner (bench/eval_engine.py) can drive besides mojo-dllm.

An engine answers one prompt and reports the text, the generation time and what it knows about the work done.
`eval_engine.py` does everything else (the prompt, scoring, the arm file, resuming, power), so an engine is
only the part that differs: how to start it and how to read what it printed.

To add one, write a class with the members of `Engine`, decorate it with `@register`, and import its module
at the bottom of this file.
