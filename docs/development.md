# Development

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --frozen                      # the pinned Mojo toolchain, in .venv
scripts/ci-local.sh --install-hooks
```

`scripts/ci-local.sh` also needs shellcheck, markdownlint-cli2 (`npm install
--global markdownlint-cli2@0.23.2`), mdBook 0.4.40 and an authenticated `gh`. A missing tool
fails its step; it never skips it.

The hooks run `scripts/ci-local.sh --fast` before each commit (hygiene scan,
`mojo format`, `-Werror` build) and the full set before each push.

## The gates

`scripts/ci-local.sh` runs the gates of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and, on a
machine with a GPU, the GPU tests that CI only builds:

| Step | Command | Fails when |
|---|---|---|
| hygiene | `scripts/check_hygiene.sh --tracked` | a credential pattern or the author's employer name appears in tracked text |
| format | `uv run --frozen mojo format -q src tests bench`, then `git diff` | `mojo format` changes any file (Mojo has no check mode) |
| build | `scripts/build.sh` | any compiler warning (`-Werror`) |
| tests | `scripts/run-tests.sh` | a test fails, a file runs zero tests, or the total differs from `tests/test-count.txt` |
| launcher tests | `uv run --frozen --only-group test pytest tests/python -q` | a test of the `./mojo-dllm` launcher fails |
| shellcheck, yamllint, markdownlint | `shellcheck --severity=warning scripts/*.sh .githooks/*`; `uv run --frozen --only-group lint yamllint --strict .github`; `markdownlint-cli2 "*.md" "docs/**/*.md" "#docs/spec.md"` | any of the three reports a finding |
| claims | `uv run --no-project python scripts/bench_table.py --check` | a table in the README, `docs/benchmarks.md` or `docs/correctness.md` differs from what `bench/results`, `bench/parity`, `bench/quality` and `bench/eval` render |
| docs | `mdbook build` + `scripts/check_links.py` | a relative link is broken |
| action pins | `scripts/verify-action-pins.sh` (needs an authenticated `gh`) | a pinned SHA is not the tag its comment names |
| eval self-test | `uv run --no-project python bench/eval_gsm8k.py --self-test` | answer extraction or the paired statistics break, or `gsm8k-200.jsonl` is not 200 rows with numeric answers |
| checker self-test | `uv run --frozen --only-group fixtures python scripts/check_weights.py --self-test` | a safetensors or index guard in `check_weights.py` stops rejecting its case, or stops naming it |
| no GPU | `scripts/check_no_gpu.sh` | `--device gpu` without a GPU does anything but exit 1 with a message |
| visual options | `scripts/check_visual.sh` | an invalid `--visual-interval` does not exit 1 with a message naming the flag before model loading |
| GPU tests | `scripts/run-gpu-tests.sh` (local only) | a GPU kernel or the GPU forward pass disagrees with the CPU or the f32 reference, or the count differs from `tests/gpu/test-count.txt` |

GitHub's runners have no GPU, so CI builds the GPU suite without running it.
`ci-local.sh` runs it when `nvidia-smi` lists a GPU and otherwise prints a
`SKIP` line, never a `PASS`; `run-gpu-tests.sh` on its own exits 1 without a
GPU.

The test count is pinned because Mojo's `TestSuite` exits 0 after running zero
tests. If you add tests, run `UPDATE_TEST_COUNT=1 scripts/run-tests.sh` (for
`tests/gpu/`, `UPDATE_TEST_COUNT=1 scripts/run-gpu-tests.sh`) and commit the
new count with them.

## Tests

`scripts/run-tests.sh` compiles each `tests/test_*.mojo` and runs it. Fixtures
live in `tests/fixtures/` and come from scripts, never from hand:

| Fixture | Made by | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| `kquants.gguf`, `bad-magic.gguf`, `tiny-llada.gguf`, `tiny-llada.expected.f32`, `tiny-dream.gguf`, `tiny-dream.expected.f32`, `malformed/`, `metadata/` | `scripts/gen_fixtures.py` | GGUF parsing and rejection, decoders, `ModelConfig` validation, the forward pass against a numpy reference |
| `tiny-diffusion-gemma.gguf`, `diffusion-gemma/` | `scripts/gen_fixtures.py` | the `diffusion-gemma` config (seed 610061): a 2-layer model with one sliding and one global layer, 4 experts, the tensor names and types of the real file, and one file per refusal (metadata only, or zero-filled tensors) |
| `dequant-types.gguf`, `unsupported-embedding.gguf` | `scripts/gen_fixtures.py` | Q8_0/Q5_K/BF16/Q5_0 references (seed 340034) and embedding rejection before CPU/GPU allocation (no RNG) |
| `llada-tokenizer.gguf`, `llada-tokenizer-golden.tsv`, `dream-tokenizer.gguf`, `dream-tokenizer-golden.tsv` | `scripts/gen_tokenizer_fixture.py` | tokenizer ids against `llama-tokenize` |
| `gemma4-tokenizer-golden.tsv`, `gemma4-tokenizer-golden.provenance.json` | `scripts/gen_tokenizer_fixture.py --golden-only` | DiffusionGemma tokenizer ids against `llama-tokenize` from the ggml-org/llama.cpp#24423 branch at the commit `scripts/build_dg_ref.sh` pins; the provenance file records that commit, the model file's sha256 and the command |
| `golden-generation.tsv` | `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 build/tests/test_golden` | tiny LLaDA/Dream token sequences, forward-pass counts, early stopping and per-step commits |
| `src/mojo_dllm/tokenizer/unicode_tables.mojo` | `scripts/gen_unicode_tables.py` | code point classes from llama.cpp's own tables |
| `moe-q5.bin`, `moe-q8.bin`, `moe-q4-q5.bin`, `moe-q4-q8.bin` | `scripts/gen_moe_fixture.py` | deterministic raw expert tensors for scalar MoE comparisons, including mixed activation block sizes |
| GGUF/source tensor shape report | `scripts/check_weights.py` (`--self-test`) | LLaDA and Dream name mapping and safetensors header shapes; run with `uv run --only-group fixtures python scripts/check_weights.py MODEL.gguf INDEX.json` (the second argument may be one `.safetensors` file) |

`tests/gpu/test_gpu.mojo` holds the GPU tests: each kernel against the CPU
function it replaces, and the GPU forward pass on both tiny models against the
f32 reference.

The tiny model is 2 layers of hidden size 256 with random K-quant blocks. Its
expected logits come from a float numpy forward pass over the weights that
the `gguf` package dequantizes, so the Mojo forward pass is checked against
the reference formats, not against itself.

### Sampler goldens

`tests/test_golden.mojo` pins current behavior on the tiny fixtures. These
outputs come from mojo-dllm itself: they detect changes, not independent
correctness. The numpy forward-pass tests and real-model parity runs provide
that evidence. No model download or GPU is needed.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/build.sh tests/test_golden.mojo build/tests/test_golden
build/tests/test_golden
# Only after reviewing an intentional behavior change:
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 build/tests/test_golden
```

Only `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` writes the file. Normal runs reject missing, empty,
duplicate, unknown or incomplete cases and compare tokens and schedule metadata
exactly. A mismatch names the case, the first differing token position (including
the prompt), both token lists and both complete rows. A golden diff in a PR needs
a sentence explaining why behavior changed, and `test_model.mojo` must still
pass. Do not regenerate merely to silence a failure on another machine; inspect
the differing logits and select a case without an unstable near-tie.

The 14 cases cover LLaDA block geometry, uneven transfer counts, serial commits,
random remasking, temperature and early stop, plus Dream's three confidence
rules, uneven timesteps, nondefault `eps` and early stop. LLaDA uses prompt
`[5, 17, 300]`; Dream uses `[448, 50, 134]` because the original prompt gave
identical all-49 outputs for D1 and D5. To avoid duplicate token lists, L5 uses
seed 1, D2 uses `eps=0.2`, D3 uses a 12-token canvas and D4 uses `eps=0.1`.
D1/D5 retain the same prompt, length and steps and differ only in `eps`.
L8/D6 use fixed stop ids 347/49 taken from the baseline outputs, never selected
at runtime. All cases disable threshold and dual-cache acceleration.

## Benchmarks

```bash
uv run --no-project python bench/run_bench.py --config bench/config.json --reps 3
uv run --no-project python scripts/bench_table.py --write
```

`bench/config.json` runs every CPU runtime in one pass and names the model
files and the llama.cpp and diffuse-cpp checkouts. The committed CPU benchmark
tables came from `bench/config-main.json`, `bench/config-diffuse.json` and
`bench/config-dream.json`; the thread sweep came from `bench/config-fair-cpu.json`. `scripts/bench_table.py` refuses a runtime that
appears in two result files, so move the files a new run replaces into
`bench/results/archive/` before `--write`. The harness waits for an idle CPU before each run, interleaves the
runtimes, switches the power profile to `performance` for the duration, and
writes a result file with every raw run. On a laptop it measures on mains
power only: unplugged, it pauses before the next run and prints that it is
waiting for the charger, and a run the charger left midway is repeated. The
eval, the quality table and `scripts/gpu_profile.py` do the same through
`bench/power.py`; `--allow-battery` measures on battery instead and records
it. The benchmark harness kills any process named
`pytest` while it runs, because test suites from other work on the
development machine kept starting mid-benchmark. Set `"kill_pytest": false`
in a config to turn that off; the GPU configs (`bench/config-gpu.json`,
`bench/config-dream-gpu.json`) do, since a GPU run leaves the CPU nearly idle.
They compare `--device gpu` with llama.cpp's diffusion example built with
CUDA in `build-cuda/`:

```bash
cmake -B build-cuda -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86
cmake --build build-cuda --target llama-diffusion-cli
```

### GPU kernels

`scripts/gpu_profile.py` traces one `run --device gpu` with Nsight Systems
(`nsys --trace=cuda`, which ran here without root although the driver keeps
hardware counters for admins) and writes the device time per
forward pass of each kernel group to `bench/profiles/`. It does not
synchronize the stream, unlike `MOJO_DLLM_GPU_PROFILE=1`. `--root` points it at
another checkout's build for before/after comparisons, and it reports a
median-based total next to the plain sum, because a laptop GPU's clocks move
under sustained load. `--runtime llama.cpp --seq-len N` traces llama.cpp's
CUDA `llama-diffusion-cli` on the same prompt instead (it replays its forward
pass as a CUDA graph, so the trace expands graph nodes), with the same kernel
groups. `bench/bench_gpu_gemm.mojo` times each LLaDA weight
shape alone, adding up the per-forward total from the tensor types in the
GGUF.

On the development laptop the GPU is capped at 30 W and its clocks drop under
sustained load (`bench/checks/2026-10-12-gpu-power-under-load.txt`), so
compare kernels with interleaved runs (A, B, A, B) in one session rather than
against a number from another day.

### Comparing GPU dispatch changes

`bench/compare_gpu.py` compares two already-built checkouts through
`run_bench.run_mojo`, interleaving A/B and B/A rounds on one assigned GPU.
It excludes a warmup pair per generation length, records every raw run, and
rejects failures or mismatched forward counts and canvas sizes. It leaves the
system power profile and other processes alone. Keep each pair on the same
GPU; another GPU can run a different model's independent comparison.

```bash
python3 bench/compare_gpu.py --base ../base --new . --model MODEL.gguf \
  --gpu GPU-UUID --lengths 128,256,512 --reps 3 --prompts 3 \
  --out bench/results/dispatch/run.json
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-UUID python3 bench/check_gpu_dispatch.py \
  --base ../base --new . --model MODEL.gguf --arch llada \
  --out bench/checks/dispatch-exact.json
```

Use `--arch dream` for Dream. The exact check uses that model's mask token,
compares all finite logit values byte for byte at several canvas sizes, and
compares complete generated token lists. It checks preservation of the base
GPU computation, not correctness against an independent runtime. The timing
comparison runs without the synchronizing `MOJO_DLLM_GPU_PROFILE` mode.

### Quality

`bench/eval_gsm8k.py` answers a fixed 200-problem GSM8K subset
(`bench/eval/gsm8k-200.jsonl`, see `bench/eval/SOURCE.md`) and compares two
arms problem by problem: accuracy difference with a 95% interval and
McNemar's exact test. Any change that is not exact (a sampler that commits
more per step, a K/V cache) needs a comparison against the one-token-per-step
baseline before it becomes a default.

```bash
uv run --no-project python bench/eval_gsm8k.py run --model M.gguf --arm baseline
uv run --no-project python bench/eval_gsm8k.py run --model M.gguf --arm candidate -- --some-flag
uv run --no-project python bench/eval_gsm8k.py compare baseline candidate
uv run --no-project python bench/eval_gsm8k.py compare baseline candidate --limit 50
```

`compare` writes `bench/eval/<date>-<a>-vs-<b>.json`, and
`scripts/bench_table.py` turns those files into the accuracy table in
[Benchmarks](benchmarks.md). Time per problem depends on what else the
machine runs, so `--limit N` compares each arm's first N problems in run
order and writes a `-firstN` file; the table takes its times from that file.
Run that round with nothing else on the machine.

## Toolchain

Mojo is pinned to 1.1.0 and max-core to 26.6.0 in `pyproject.toml`, locked in
`uv.lock`; both come from PyPI. Bump them together by editing the two pins,
running `uv lock`, and committing that on its own with a green run: Mojo 1.1
removed `fn`, `alias` and `@parameter` closures, and each release has moved
APIs this code uses. `max-core` supplies `max.algorithm.parallelize` and the
GPU API (`max.gpu`, `max.gpu.host`). The Mojo wheels need glibc 2.34 or newer.

The Python scripts run through uv too. `uv run --no-project python script.py`
runs a script that uses only the standard library. The fixture generators and
`bench/parity.py` need numpy and gguf, pinned in the `fixtures` group:
`uv run --only-group fixtures python scripts/gen_fixtures.py`.
